# BipedalWalker
This program uses artificial intelligence to train a bipedal agent to be able to walk. The bipedal agent uses a neural network controller which is evolves using gentic algorithm to aquire optimal results. This particular program uses a population of 500 individuals evolves for 10 generations. The fitness graph for one execution can be studied in the attached .png file.
